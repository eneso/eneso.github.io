Worked on a low cost smart home project with Lam Cao, who is a CS student. With this smart outlet project, we can turn on and off outlets remotely via an integrated website as well as through voice control (Alexa). One thing that makes this project unique is the entire smart home system costs less than 100$. This project enables you to turn on/off outlets remotely, access to your smart outlets from anywhere in the world.. Another additional feature of this project is the modularity of the design. The scope of this project can easily be extended by adding additional hardware. This project was chosen as the third best project among other projects during competition.
