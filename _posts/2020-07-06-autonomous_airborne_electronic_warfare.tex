We have built a self flying quad-copter with Wi-Fi (specifically 2.4 GHz) jamming capabilities. After entering the coordinates to fly via telemetry radios from the ground station, EWS (Electronic Warfare System) was able to head there autonomously and start jamming if the coordinates to jam were met. Only human interaction with drone is when entering the coordinates to fly. Afterwards it can take off, do its course and land to the designated spot by itself. This project won the top CE Senior Project award.
